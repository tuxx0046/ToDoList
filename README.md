# To Do List
A To Do List app in ASP.NET Core.
Purpose of the project is to put into practice what I have learned in C# and ASP.NET Core.
The main focus was to work with models and create relations between entities and also to better grasp and understand TagHelpers by using them.
A side goal was also to take the first steps into learning Entity Framework Core, which I have no knowledge of as of writing this.

The project was very challenging for me, and I couldn't do it without referencing tutorials and documentation during the process.
